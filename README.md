## Description of your website, including:
### Purpose - Max

- Stoaree is a online platform allowing users to share and create compelling interviews easily with another individual based off Mark Howards line of questions. After Mark Howard created his podcast "Howie Games" which has amassed up to 20 million listens he started to get contacted to interview the loved ones of his listeners who were either sick or elderly and to capture their story and how they came to be who they're today. This soon lead to the idea of Stoaree. The purpose of Stoaree is to allow users to easily capture compelling stories from family members, friends or interesting people based off the questions Mark asks in his podcasts. Along with capturing the stories it also becomes a place to share them with the world... A social aspect allowing users to listen to stories around them. Mark wants to also capture the important memories in people's lives and allow them to easily share them amongst family members and store them in one place.
